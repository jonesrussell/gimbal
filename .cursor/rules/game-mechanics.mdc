# Game Mechanics

## Player Movement
- Player orbits around screen center at fixed radius
- Movement controlled via Arrow Keys / WASD
- Use `SceneManager.RequestQuit()` for graceful shutdown, not `os.Exit()`

## Enemy System
- Enemy types: Basic (0), Heavy (1), Boss (2)
- Movement patterns: Normal, Zigzag, Accelerating, Pulsing
- Formations: Line, Circle, V, Diamond, Diagonal, Spiral, Random

## Collision Detection
- Uses spatial hashing for efficiency
- Timeout protection: `config.CollisionTimeout` (half frame budget)
- Player has invincibility frames after taking damage

## Level Configuration
Levels are JSON files in `assets/levels/` containing:
- Waves with formations and enemy counts
- Boss configuration and difficulty multipliers
- Completion conditions

## Performance Thresholds
- Slow system threshold: `config.SlowSystemThreshold` (5ms)
- Debug logging interval: `config.DebugLogInterval` (60 frames)
- Use `ImagePool` for ebiten.Image reuse
