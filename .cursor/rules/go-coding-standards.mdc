# Go Coding Standards

## Code Style
- Follow `gofmt` formatting standards
- Use `golangci-lint` for static analysis
- Keep functions focused and under 30 lines when possible
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## Error Handling
- Return errors for recoverable conditions
- Use `common.NewGameError` and `common.NewGameErrorWithCause` for game-specific errors
- Log errors with appropriate context using structured logging
- Handle errors at the appropriate level

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for exported names, camelCase for unexported
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose over brevity
- Use consistent receiver names across similar types
- Avoid naming conflicts between different system types

## Documentation
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Use clear, concise comments that explain "why" not "what"
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Maintain good test coverage for critical systems
