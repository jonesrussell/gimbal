## üéØ **Current Sprint: ECS Code Quality & Refactoring**

### **üö® Critical ECS Issues (High Priority)**
- [ ] **Remove Unused ComponentRegistry** - Delete 191 lines of over-engineered code
  - [ ] Remove `component_registry.go` and `component_registry_test.go`
  - [ ] Update any references to use Donburi's built-in component management
  - [ ] Verify no functionality is lost

- [ ] **Consolidate Duplicate Components** - Fix DRY violation
  - [ ] Remove duplicate component definitions in `components.go` and `core/components.go`
  - [ ] Keep only `core/components.go` as the single source of truth
  - [ ] Update all imports and references

- [ ] **Extract Magic Numbers** - Improve maintainability
  - [ ] Create `internal/ecs/constants.go` for game constants
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded values in `enemy_system.go` (spawn intervals, radii, margins)
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded values in `resources.go` (sprite sizes, colors)
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded values in other systems

- [ ] **Remove System Wrapper Pattern** - Simplify architecture
  - [ ] Remove `core/system_wrappers.go` (81 lines of unnecessary boilerplate)
  - [ ] Use systems directly or implement simpler interface
  - [ ] Update `game.go` to use systems without wrappers

### **üîß Architectural Improvements (Medium Priority)**
