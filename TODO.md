## 🏗️ **Architecture Summary**

### **Before Refactoring**
```
ECS Game → Input Handler (TIGHT COUPLING)
```

### **After Refactoring**
```
ECS Game ← Input Interface ← Input Handler (LOOSE COUPLING)
     ↓
Application Container (Dependency Management)
     ↓
Configuration Validation (Safety)
     ↓
Component Registry (Organization)
```
