## üöÄ **Immediate Priority: Health System Implementation**

**Next development focus should be implementing the player health system as it will:**
1. **Complete the core gameplay loop** - shoot ‚Üí destroy ‚Üí take damage ‚Üí lives/game over
2. **Add gameplay stakes** - consequences for player mistakes
3. **Enable proper game progression** - clear win/lose conditions
4. **Provide essential feedback** - visual and mechanical player state

**Implementation approach:**
- Connect existing health system architecture to player entity
- Integrate with collision system for player-enemy damage
- Add visual feedback (invincibility flashing, lives HUD)
- Implement respawn and game over flows

**After health system, then scoring system for complete core gameplay.**
